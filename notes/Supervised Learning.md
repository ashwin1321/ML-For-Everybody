# Supervised Learning

## Classification

Classification is a type of supervised learning where the output variable is a categorical variable. The goal is to predict which category an observation belongs to based on its features. Examples include predicting whether an email is spam or not, predicting which genre a movie belongs to, and predicting whether a patient has a certain disease or not.

### Types of Classification

#### Binary Classification:

The output variable has only two possible values. For example, predicting whether an email is spam or not.

#### Multiclass Classification:

The output variable has more than two possible values. For example, predicting which genre a movie belongs to.

## Regression

Regression is a type of supervised learning where the output variable is a continuous variable. The goal is to predict the value of the output variable based on its features. Examples include predicting the price of a house, predicting the number of sales of a product, and predicting the number of hours a student will study.

### Types of Regression

#### Simple Linear Regression:

To predicting discrete values. The output variable is a linear combination of the input variables.Linear regression is a type of regression where the relationship between the input variables and the output variable is modeled using a linear function. The goal is to find the line that best fits the data and can be used to make predictions for new observations. Examples include predicting the price of a house based on its features, predicting the temperature for the next day, and predicting the amount of rainfall for a given location.

#### Logistic Regression:

To predict continous values. Logistic regression is a type of regression where the output variable is a categorical variable, and the relationship between the input variables and the output variable is modeled using a logistic function. The goal is to predict the probability of an observation belonging to a certain category. Examples include predicting the likelihood of a customer buying a product, predicting the likelihood of a student passing an exam, and predicting the likelihood of a patient having a certain disease.
